sprint review and retrospective
# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs by performing daily scrum with my team. This allows me to develop a better knowledge of the wants and needs of the project. Doing this will allow me to implement them into a program. Creating user stories helps us plan around the needs and wants of the project, which then allows us to develop the best possible product.
# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach developing programs on always asking myself why. Doing this allows me to better understand why I am developing a certain way and also allows me to understand what I may be doing wrong and can improve the product. I honestly hope to include them all only because they are all important in some type of way. Working on using all of these in the future will allow me to grow as a developer and I personally am really excited to see where it takes me.
# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member in software development could mean different things to different people but I personally believe that to be a good team member you need to be a key player and always ask questions. Communication is key in my opinion in being a good team member in software development or anything in general.
